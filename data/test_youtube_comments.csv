The suffering was real for generations and must be given full throated acknowledgment unless you just don't care.  OR, she is being flippant cause she pandered to the daughters of the confederacy in south Carolina in 2010. Look it up.  Then she pissed them off when she took down their Confederate flag.

It's because they benefit from it socially and economically. Do they really want to change? Absolutely not because they teach and practice this to their descendants or children in the home, in literature, schools, media, workplace and throughout society and the world.  Don't take my word for it just look at their history and now look at the present; they have never let go of their hate, greed, theft, oppression, lies, abuse, destruction, division, racism and murderous ways when it comes to black and brown people.  Now I ask you, are these the Acts of Good people or the Acts of Devils? 😐🤫... White's in general need their ungodly Racism because without it they are powerless...  Let's not forget Evil comes in all colors it's just a little bit more prevalent throughout the world with them.

I know Cecil when I see it Sir Charles and Trump is not the enemy of Black Americans. For Charles to say he will “punch any Black man in the face if he sees them wearing a Trump shirt”. I was paraphrasing on that quote. Trump isn’t your enemy Sir Charles. I just do not want the Democratic Party to use racial bating to get Black Americans to vote democrat I’m seriously asking them not to do that. 2O16 - 2O21 damn near destroyed our country with the racial tension and discord. I truly believed the powers that be wanted us to kill each other in a race war. I though we were on the brink and the elites were stoking the flames too.

When Nikki gives her campaign speeches, she is not talking to nor including the Black population. 
She talks about not wanting to have a conversation with children about this being a racist country because of the effect it would have on their minds. The problem is, Black families have been having ""The Talk"" with their children for decades. So whose children is she referring to? Everybody's...if you don't include Black children. 
Growing up they reminded us every year that this country was built on racism. Martin Luther King Jr Holiday and Black History Month was filled with movies, pics and stories of Jim Crow, segregation and slavery. Black people being beaten and killed. Showing our Black leaders that were important to the Civil Rights movement being killed, and our neighborhoods being burnt down. And reminding us of where we weren't wanted, lunch counters, buses, schools and swimming pools. There were a whole lot of other things, all because of the color of our skin. And they didn't leave out younger children, they had racist cartoons as well.
The month didn't used to be a celebration of Black people, it was basically taking racist people down memory lane of the ""good ol' times"" or should I say ""great"" in America. So like I said when, ""Miss I don't see the problem with the Confederate flag"" talks she is not talking to nor including the Black population.",2024-02-24T23:25:31Z,0,0

Nikki Haley keeps burying herself. She does not deserve to be president let alone VP because she has the back of nobody in America. She just wants to be the next president. 
She is just like Trump except the violence. She keeps gaslighting people. I am ashamed. A candidate who says Trump was respected abroad and was needed at the time or again she would vote for Trump even if convicted, does not deserve to be elected to any position. She tries to excuse herself by saying she signed the RNC pledge but come on, we are talking about a felon and someone who has and can endanger America because Trump would sell the country if he is given money or a piece of land to play golf.

You educate people on the history, so they don't repeat it.  Jewish people have no problem educating people on the holocaust and the atrocities of Nazi Germany, yet when African Americans want to talk about the atrocities committed due to white supremacy suddenly, we don't want to upset anyone therefore, racism is able to find refuge once again.    I feel the more informed white people are of the past the better chance we have as a nation to beat this cancer called racism.

Keeping white people void of our American history allows Nikki Haley to perpetuate this false hood that we have rid ourselves of racism.  Guess what Mrs. Haley, institutionalized racism is still alive and thriving and your part of the problem.  The premise of America was always racist because they didn't even view African Americans as men...they were considered property!

This is recognized everywhere. You have to speak the language and know the laws and culture of a nation.

To prioritize diversity kills a nation. You need standards and a culture. The US does not have this and that is why criminality is rampant, broken homes being a norm, and a significant decline in fertility impacts the necessary blue collar jobs. On top of that, the DIE programs (Diversity, Inclusion, Equity) are flat out encouraging students to waste their lives in college with debt they cannot pay off.

Nikki can argue that the meaning of what she said is being distorted, and that would not be a lie. A person could choose to agree or disagree with her on that point, but she wouldn't be lying. However, for her to say she never said the EXACT words she actually said VERBATIM is a disgusting lie.

All that said, she's running in the primary against a man that is about 1000x as vile a liar as she is. So 🤷‍♂️",2024-02-22T16:03:23Z,0,0

The 3/5th compromise in no way was anti-racist. The 3/5th compromise was a legal acknowledgment of slavery, that the southern states had a large slave population which created a population representation disadvantage for the North.  This ""compromise"" forced the South to count their slave population with a 3/5ths count. It didnt make an anti-slavery statement; it made a agreement to uphold it while reducing the South's political power. Keep in mind, regardless of the compromise, slaves couldn't vote themselves.  
In fact, many argue that if slavery's free labor didn't exist, there would be no USA!  
So, what is there not to understand?",2024-02-29T22:30:38Z,1,

The Constitution literally describes black people as 3/5 of a person.  Nikki Haley seems very disingenuous when she speaks about racism.  When I grew up in Indiana, some white people (certainly not all) made sure that I knew I was not the same as them - i.e. “equal” - and were absolutely against me.  I graduated from a Catholic HS.  The guidance counselor told me I would never be accepted to the university that would later become my Alma Mater even though I was an honors student and my GPA was well north of 3.0.  A Catholic priest told me I was “full of 💩” when I asked why other black students were being denied various honors they had earned while white students who accomplished less were being recognized.  I was the president of student council; so, it was not like I did not have access to the evaluation process.  I was routinely told by well-meaning white folk to make sure I was out of their neighborhood before it got dark outside.  Nikki Haley is right about one thing, though.  “Nobody knew what we were” sounds like an accurate description, as I did not know she was Indian until she began campaigning for Trump in 2020.  Unfortunately, America’s racist tendencies, especially as such inclinations relate to African Americans, are well documented in the very document that forms this nation, the U.S. Constitution.  To say that “America has never been a racist nation”, fails to recognize the struggles many of us have to overcome to claim what little we have.  I have NEVER believed that I could not achieve based on how I was treated by people in this society.  Nonetheless, I could not ever vote for a candidate who thinks what I went through is a collection of misunderstandings rather than a system devaluation of who I am be my potential based on the color of my skin.",2024-02-22T13:56:29Z,4,2

'I was upset': Charles Barkley questions Haley on 'racist country' remark,@dimanes2,"Nikki Haley is either stupid or a pathological liar if she thinks America did not have racism at its core. That it also had the tools to undo that (a task which is not complete) can also be true. These are not mutually exclusive premises. For her to look at a nation which was founded on racially based slavery, discrimination against the IPs, that enacted laws restricting citizenship to certain groups, that had to fight a civil war just to start us on the right path, that codified second-class citizenship on huge swaths of the population and say ""nothing to see here"" is insulting. To be clear, I love this country. I want to see it get better. And, with the exception of the last few years, I think it has. If Haley were arguing that we have come a long way since the Founding and that we have done that, in part, using the tools the Founders baked into the country, I would be in general agreement. But her statements on this issue are meant to pander to the racists among us, making them feel more comfortable in their bigotry and placing the blame on the victims, not the perpetrators (notice how she essentially says that people whose lives have been negatively impacted by racism are basically holding themselves back).

'I was upset': Charles Barkley questions Haley on 'racist country' remark,@YesMayhem7,"Nikki could not bring herself to listen.  That in itself is not a good sign.   Intention does not override decades of racism backed by policy and practice.  She cannot equate an east Indian experience of perceived racism and strategy to avoid it, with the actual hurdles and blockers American's classified as ""Black"" still traverse.  It's likely her mother did not want her children to think they are seen by society as incapable.  That has not been the perception in the US.  

For us the intentions and stereotypes have been clear.  It's strange Nikki equates telling children racism exists with the actual inability to achieve.  As if hearing about racism is what makes it a reality.   Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil does not work here.  At least, not for us.  I knew racism existed when I got off the bus and walked into my classroom to see an image of Sambo on the chalkboard.  There were teachers who were professional and encouraging, and then there were teachers who would go so far as to be verbally abusive and violent.   Strange enough I was removed from class and choked for alluding to a teacher's prejudice.  

India is no stranger to this.  India has its own caste system which is problematic for its own populations classified as a permanent lower class.  That existed when I visited India in 2004.  Watching BBC I saw Brahmin students who strongly believed Dalit's should not join them in university.  This mindset still exists from what I scan now.   This mindset cannot see the trail of destructive policies, practices and their vehicles; settler practices, slave trade, slavery, Jim Crow, sharecropping, eugenics, segregation, housing, farming, massacres, education, employment, commerce, financial, redlining, incarceration, media communications, population.  The list is incomplete.

Both Nikki and Vivek want to analyze, and platform based on their perspective.  Their experience and global diaspora of labor and commerce, mainly upper caste.  If Nikki can't listen, consider beyond her circle, why should I vote against my interests.  The four corners of my family were here before the 1800s.  Our efforts have been devalued, exploited and overlooked for that long.   We've started over again several times.  We all worked hard.  Even in our fortunate gains life requires hard work and the ability to sustain.  In a lifetime you're liable to realize the hurdles with few supports.  The challenges thrown at you that snag the fruits of your work; The policies and practices that tuck hurdles in landownership, home ownership, employment, higher education has been limited.  We have had someone who has fought in almost every war since 1812.  To hear Nikki assert what I deal with and can give account of as inequitable and destabilizing, does not exist is more than upsetting.  It makes no sense.  Nikki is not ignorant of what she says.  She just refuses to speak on our experience.  She'd rather redefine it from her perspective.  She'd rather say it does not exist.",2024-02-22T12:01:32Z,0,0

The thirteenth and fourteenth amendments were both set against a period where a large part of the country was trying to avoid applying rights to african americans. The justice department was created in that context and largely for that reason.

Segregation was part of the country's structure. And let's not forget, the founders expressed racist sentiments as well, Jefferson was a slave owner to the day he died, and his wealth was built on that.

If you can imagine walking from Canada to Mexico, then you understand what it means when people walked from Rome to Oslo to celebrate him. 

USA is a very racist country. Even the non-racist are non-racist in a racist way. Cultures take centuries to change. I know that racism isn't natural. Because my first friend was a refugee from Sri Lanka. We were seven and he didn't look like me and we didn't have any words in common, but we were the best of friends. In those days, seeing people of a different colour was very rare in Norway, but nobody ever told me that he was different. I just didn't know and I had no reason to invent racism for myself. 

I was trained to believe that Christians are better than other people. My family objected, but society told me this. And I was trained to believe that men and women are unequal. My family told me otherwise, but society still told me this. 

We had all the other bigotries, but racism did not exist in my world. And only a very stupid Norwegian _can_ be a racist, because a thousand years ago, we went to Greenland. And we starved to death and froze to death because we thought that we were superior to the natives who thrived in that environment. And we now know that they were Norwegian in origin. Stupid must be stopped in general, because stupid is stupid.

However, because the majority of the racists in the US were white, the double standard of racism (as in you are encouraged to be vocally anti white and openly support white replacement) is now towards whites.

Natives are still on reservations in the US due to racism. Now figure that out? There has been few Native governors and no Native president. That was by culture, the design and spirit of the nation. Then Jim Crow going unchallenged for decades and redlining, when local governments and businessess participated, clearly shows societal racism. Now here is dead end proof. Muhammad Ali refused the draft because of religious conviction. But he could have went another route. Minority veterans were cheated out of their GI Bill benefits and the federal government did not protect them or reimburse their families for the economic losses. Ali could have called the government a liar in its promises and benefits and declared the US federal government untrust worthy to engage in life and death matter with. What was done to thousands of minority veterans also could be done to Ali, unless the government rectified its ways in treating Blacks.  That was in the early 1960""s. This same government has since paid Japanese Americans for their illegal imprisonment during WWII but has to this day still not reimbursed the veterans families slighted by racism during WWII. So why has the US admitted wrong doing with Japanese Americans and not the same with Minority veterans? The only logical and visible answer is racism. The US owes trillions in debt to its minority citizens because of its unequal protections in employment, economics and politics. And it also highlights the US government as political kingdom of  double standards. Trying to rights its wrongs is very low visibility but trying to maintain the achieved and stolen power structure is very visible.

Why is it that any perceived slight to the mantra ""America is racist"" is always the knee jerk top issue in every Presidential election especially for the Democrats? When has Gayle King talked about the absolute mess in education which especially hits African Americans hard which leads indirectly to high African American male incarceration rates and single family homes which affect African Americans the most.  After all the BLM brouhaha, have these problems been resolved even an inch ? No! These are issues which need her to champion and push the agenda hard and with equal measure an honest assessment of the situation and not dwell in these wordplay ""gotcha"" moments that she or the people on the View love to dwell on. Kudos to Charles as I have heard him talk about these issues and the sincerity to want to help solve them. With people like Gayle King, it's no wonder the left of the Democratic party is losing voters.

Haley is the best candidate out there that will talk about these issues face up and bring the best solutions to the country. Not Trump who is a racist and certainly not Biden is the the ""View"" all over again.
